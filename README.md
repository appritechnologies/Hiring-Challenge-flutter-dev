# Flutter Mobile Application Developer Intern Hiring Challenge

Welcome to the Flutter Mobile Application Developer Intern Hiring Challenge! We are excited to evaluate your skills and potential to join our team as a software engineering intern working on our productivity mobile app solution for SME enterprises. This challenge is designed to assess your proficiency in Flutter app development, problem-solving abilities, and attention to detail.

## Challenge Description

You will be building a simple Flutter mobile application that demonstrates your ability to create a user-friendly interface and handle data management. This application will simulate a task management tool for SME enterprises. The main functionalities you need to implement are as follows:

### Task List Screen

1. Create a screen with a list of tasks. Each task should display its title, due date, and priority level (e.g., low, medium, high).
2. Implement a way to add new tasks to the list.
3. Implement a way to mark tasks as completed and remove them from the list.

### Task Detail Screen

1. When a user taps on a task in the list, navigate to a detailed view.
2. Display all the task details, including title, description, due date, and priority level.
3. Provide an option to edit the task details and save the changes.

### Additional Requirements

1. Use a state management solution (e.g., Provider, Bloc, or Riverpod) to manage the application's state.
2. Store task data locally using a suitable storage solution (e.g., Hive, SQLite, or SharedPreferences).
3. Ensure that the user interface is responsive and looks good on both Android and iOS devices.
4. Implement proper error handling and validation for user inputs.
5. Write clean and organized code with comments where necessary.
6. Provide a README file with instructions on how to build and run your app.
